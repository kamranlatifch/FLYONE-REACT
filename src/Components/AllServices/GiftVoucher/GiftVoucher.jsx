        5: <b>Purchase and use of FLYONE vouchers</b>
        <br />
        Vouchers can be purchased for different occasions:
        <br />
        <br />
        Gift Voucher
        <br />
        Anniversary Voucher
        <br />
        Special Day Voucher
        <br />
        When purchasing a voucher, the Client shall provide the name of the
        person to whom he/she wishes to give the voucher.
        <br />
        FLYONE vouchers can be used to pay for FLYONE flights (including
        mandatory taxes, fees and charges) as well as additional services
        purchased together with the booked flight ticket (only at the time of
        booking) and which are available during the booking process (such as:
        baby fee, priority boarding, extra legroom, luggage fees).
        <br />
        The FLYONE voucher cannot be used for the purchase of services that do
        not appear in the booking process.
        <br />
        If the value of the FLYONE voucher does not cover the total cost of the
        flight and added services (if any), you must make an additional payment
        using a bank card. If the value of the voucher exceeds the total cost of
        the flight and added services, the remaining amount can be used for the
        next flight. The voucher is valid until the amount is fully spent.
        <br />
        It is possible to use the FLYONE voucher for bookings made in a
        different currency than the one specified on the FLYONE voucher. The
        price of the flight tickets and services selected will be converted into
        the currency chosen for the payment to be made during the booking at the
        exchange rate used by FLYONE at the time of booking.
        <br />
        Validity of vouchers
        <br />
        FLYONE vouchers can be used until the amount is fully spent. The trip
        must be made within 12 months of the purchase of the voucher. Otherwise,
        after this period, the voucher will no longer be valid. The validity of
        FLYONE vouchers cannot be extended. FLYONE vouchers are non-refundable
        and cannot be modified.
        <br />
