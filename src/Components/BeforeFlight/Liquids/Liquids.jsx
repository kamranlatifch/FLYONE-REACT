        <h4>EU RULES OF SECURITY REGARDING TRANSPORTING LIQUIDS</h4>
        <br />
        The European Union has adopted a set of rules of security, which
        strictly limit the quantity of liquids that you can transport in your
        luggage.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some of the liquids are:
        <br />
        <li>
          Beverages, including water and other refreshing drinks, soups, syrups
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Creams, lotions and oils</li>
        <br />
        <li>Perfume</li>
        <br />
        <li>Deodorant spray</li>
        <br />
        <li>Gels, including hair gels and shower gels</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The content of the recipients under pressure, including shaving foam,
          other foams and deodorants
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Mixtures of liquid and solid substances</li>
        <br />
        <li>Cosmetic products for make-up</li>
        <br />
        <li>Other items with similar consistency</li>
        <br />
        <li>When you pack</li>
        <br />
        Take into account that each liquid must be in its own recipient, whose
        capacity must not exceed 100 ml. These liquids will not exceed the
        maximum limit of 1000 ml per person/passenger, all taken together. The
        recipients must be packed in plastic, transparent and resealable bags.
        The items must be loosely stored and the bag must be sealed. Only one
        bag with liquids is allowed per passenger.
        <br />
        <br />
        The bag must be presented separately at the airport’s security control.
        These rules apply to all of the passengers leaving from EU airports, no
        matter the destination.
        <br />
        <br />
        Passengers departing from a non-EU country landing in one EU country
        will comply with these rules. Remember, you will not be allowed to
        transport liquids in a quantity bigger than 1000 ml in the hand luggage,
        given the above conditions.
        <br />
        <br />
        It is allowed:
        <br />
        To introduce liquids in the registered luggage, the new rules are
        applicable only to the hand luggage
        <br />
        To take medicine and the necessary products to a special diet, including
        products for the babies, destined to be used during the trip. You may be
        requested to prove that the products will be used on board.
        <br />
        To buy liquids, like drinks or perfumes at the shops in the EU airports,
        placed far away from where you are requested to present your boarding
        ticket or from the board of the EU operated airlines. If these liquids
        are sold in special sealed bags, do not open them before passing the
        security control, otherwise, the content of the bag may be confiscated
        at the control points (if you are transferring from one airport to
        another in EU, do not open the bag before passing the control at the
        transfer airport, or at the last transfer airport, if you get
        transferred several times).
        <br />
        These liquids are additional to the quantities stipulated for the bags
        with closing/opening elements, mentioned above.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          Help the security personnel identify the liquids! In order to do that,
          you must:
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Present all of the liquid substances that you have to the security
          personnel, in order to get examined
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Take off all coats, trenches and jackets. These are controlled
          separately
        </li>
        <br />
