      <h4>SMOKING ON THE AIRPLANE’S BOARD</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        As we have previously mentioned, the main objective of FLYONE is the
        safety and comfort of its passengers. Therefore, in order to provide an
        ecological pure space in its airplanes’ cabins, all of the company’s
        flights are non-smoking.
        <br />
        <br />
        Smoking is prohibited on the FLYONE’s airplanes boards and the smoke
        detectors that are installed in the cabin and toilet help keep this
        unchanged. We ask the passengers to respect this rule of behavior, whose
        infringement may attract additional sanctions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thank you for your understanding!
