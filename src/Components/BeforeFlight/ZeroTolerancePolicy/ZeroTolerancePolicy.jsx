      <h4>GENERAL POLICY</h4>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Our main objective is to ensure an excellent level of safety and
        security for all FLYONEâ€™s customers and staff. Unruly passengers can
        create serious safety hazards by interfering with the operation of an
        aircraft. These are a nuisance to other passengers and a danger to
        themselves in an emergency situation.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unruly passengers will be reported to the responsible authorities and
        may face legal consequences (fines, retention).
        <br />
        <br />
        Passengers should be aware that FLYONE is permitted to deny boarding to
        anyone who behaves in an unruly or disruptive manner. The unruly
        passenger is not entitled to a refund.
        <br />
        <br />
        FLYONE believes that prevention is the main strategy in dealing with
        unruly passengers and acts accordingly.
        <br />
        <br />
        WARNING: FLYONE declares Zero Tolerance Policy to be applied!
        <br />
        <br />
        FLYONE Zero Tolerance Policy:
        <br />
        - empowers crews and ground staff to take reasonable steps to prevent
        disruptive and drunken behavior and, to deal with it as effectively as
        practicable including refusal of carriage of passengers who have the
        potential to create the disturbances;
        <br />
        - supports crews and ground staff taking such action;
        <br />
        - encourages the police to prosecute disruptive passengers in
        appropriate cases, especially when there have been assaults on FLYONE
        staff;
        <br />
        - assists and supports crew members and ground staff who are required,
        after an incident, to give witness statements to the police or to appear
        in court proceedings when unruly passengers are prosecuted;
        <br />
        - provides appropriate training to crew and ground staff in dealing with
        conflicts;
        <br />
        - denies future carriage to abusive passengers who remain a threat to
        employees of the company;
        <br />
        - encourages Ground Staff to detect and report disruptive behavior at
        check-in, in the lounges and at the boarding gate in order to prevent
        such passengers from boarding;
        <br />
        - Keeps Ground Staff, Cabin Crew and Flight Crew aware of potentially
        disruptive passengers.
        <br />
        <br />
        FLYONE policy applies equally to all passengers regardless of their
        class of travel or status.
