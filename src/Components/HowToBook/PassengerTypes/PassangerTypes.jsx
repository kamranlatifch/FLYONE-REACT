            Accepting persons with locomotor disabilities on board is based on
            two main factors.
            <br />
            <br />
            These are:
            <br />
            - The ability of the handling agent to provide such kind of services
            (the necessary equipment and the instructed personnel)
            <br />
            - Limitations (the maximum number of PRM on board, depending of the
            airplane type and acceptance on board of certain PRM categories)

          Ensuring the comfort for a person with disabilities during a flight
          involves a series of factors like the health condition of the
          passenger, the required equipment, the carrier and the type of the
          aircraft.
          <br />
          <br />
          This is why the passenger must request the service for the people with
          disabilities with at least 72 hours prior to the scheduled departure,
          so that the carrier can make all the necessary arrangements. The given
          request can be made during booking, when the agent introduces all the
          necessary information.
          <br />
          <br />
          In case the passenger has certain diseases, considered medical cases,
          the company FLYONE will additionally request medical certificates that
          attest the health state of the passenger. Therefore, the special MEDIF
          form will be completed by the passenger's doctor and sent to the
          company.
          <br />
          <br />
          It is very important to us to know to what extent your mobility is
          reduced. You can find some guidance in the three categories in order
          to establish the disability degree:
          <br />
          WCHR – Wheelchair Ramp: the passenger requests the wheelchair for long
          distances and is capable to climb stairs without assistance;
          <br />
          WCHS – Wheelchair Steps: the passenger can walk short distances, but
          cannot climb stairs;
          <br />
          WCHC – Wheelchair Cabin: the passenger requires permanent assistance.
          S/He cannot get on board without assistance and the wheelchair is a
          strong necessity.
          <br />
          <br />
          In case the disabled passenger is going to travel with the personal
          wheelchair, s/he will contact the transporter in order to inform on
          the weight, dimensions and other special characteristics
          (pliable/non-pliable, sport/electrically auctioned, etc).
          <br />
          <br />
          The electrically powered wheelchairs, working on a battery, are
          accepted on board on special conditions. First of all, these batteries
          need to be dry or with gel to avoid liquid leakage and must be
          disassembled in order to be separately isolated, before taking off.
          The electrical wheelchairs, powered by wet or lithium batteries will
          not be accepted on board.
          <br />
          <br />
          The company FLYONE accepts the mobility equipment (wheelchair,
          crutches or auxiliary equipment) on board free of charge. The
          equipment is transported only in the luggage department.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Pet guides for PRM</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          The pets that accompany a passenger with reduced mobility are accepted
          on board free of charge and the passenger will inform the company
          while booking the ticket.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Guide Pets are accepted, provided that the following conditions
          are complied:
          <br />
          • The weight and size are not restricted
          <br />
          • The passenger needs to have a certificate, confirming the status of
          Animal Guide
          <br />
          • They are not allowed to walk around the cabin
          <br />
          • They must not occupy a seat
          <br />
          • They must not be placed in a container
          <br />
          • They need to wear a muzzle and a leash
          <br />
          <br />
          The passengers with hearing and visual impairments
          <br />
          <br />
          If the passenger has (partial) hearing or visual impairment, it is
          recommended that s/he informs the agent/company, when booking the
          ticket in order to receive proper assistance. There is no need to
          present any confirming medical document.
          <br />
          <br />
          The passengers with total hearing or visual impairment can travel only
          if accompanied. The passengers with reduced mobility or sensorial
          perception deficiencies can express their preference for some seats.
          Out of legal reasons related to the flight’s safety, they can be
          restricted on certain rows (for example: the safety exits).
